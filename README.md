# How to install?

Just install it away like a regular Drupal module. The mass import function is there.  
Type in comma-separated values inside the textarea. Optionally, include comments that will be added to every data.  
If any data includes a comma (or double quote), just enclose the whole data with double quotes ". For example:
`"Doe, John",johndoe@test.com`

# What did I accomplish?

I learned what is CMS and how it works as another abstraction layer above the programming language (PHP + MySQL in this case).  
But... that's it. I don't put much effort in this task :/
